# fresco-bgw
An implementation of the BGW protocol for secure multi-party computation for the <a href="https://github.com/aicis/fresco">FRESCO</a> framework in the semi-honest setting.

The protocol is implemented as described in "A Pragmatic Introduction to Secure Multi-Party Computation" by Evans, Kolesnikov and Rosulek. The original protocol was described in Ben-Or, M., S. Goldwasser, and A. Wigderson. 1988. “Completeness Theorems for Non-Cryptographic Fault-Tolerant Distributed Computation (Extended Abstract)”. In: 20th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. ACM Press. 1–10.
